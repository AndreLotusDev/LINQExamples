Aggregate - coding exercise 1
Imagine you are working on an activity tracker app. On the main screen, we want to show the user the total activity time for the current day.

Using the Aggregate method, implement the TotalActivityDuration method, which given a collection of integers representing activities durations in seconds will return a TimeSpan object representing the total time of activity.

For example, for durations {10, 50, 121} the result shall be a TimeSpan object with a total duration of 3 minutes and 1 second.

using System;
using System.Linq;
using System.Collections.Generic;

namespace Coding.Exercise
{
    public class Exercise
    {
        public static TimeSpan TotalActivityDuration(
            IEnumerable<int> activityTimesInSeconds)
        {
           return TimeSpan.FromSeconds(
                activityTimesInSeconds.Aggregate((sum, x) => sum + x));
        }
    }
}
