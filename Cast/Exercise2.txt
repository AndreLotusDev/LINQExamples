Collection type change - coding exercise 2
Implement the CreateLookupByDivisibilityBy2 method, which given a collection of numbers will create a Lookup with the key being a boolean saying if the number is divisible by 2, and the value will be all numbers for whom this boolean says if they are divisible by 2.

For example, for input {1,2,4,5,6,7,9}, the result shall be a Lookup with two keys and the following values:

[true] = {2,4,6}

[false] = {1,5,7,9}

using System;
using System.Linq;
using System.Collections.Generic;

namespace Coding.Exercise
{
    public class Exercise
    {
        public static ILookup<bool, int> CreateLookupByDivisibilityBy2(IEnumerable<int> input)
        {
            return input.ToLookup(l => l % 2 == 0);
        }
    }
}
