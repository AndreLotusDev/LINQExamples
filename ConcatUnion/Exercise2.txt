Concat and Union - coding exercise 2
Implement the CleanWord method, which given a string that can consist of letters and non-letter characters, will return a new string, where all letters proceed the non-letter characters. The non-letter characters should be unique in the result.

For example:

for input "f_o!_!x" the result will be "fox_!". Please note that only the first "!" is present in the result according to this rule "The non-letter characters should be unique in the result."

for input "d_3uc(k))" the result will be "duck_3()". Please note that only the first ")" is present in the result according to this rule "The non-letter characters should be unique in the result."
