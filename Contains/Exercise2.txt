Contains - coding exercise 2
Implement the CountFriendsOf method. This method takes the friend parameter and a collection of people. We want to count all those people, who have the friend amongst their friends.

For example, in this case, the result of the method should be 3 because there are 3 people who have friend in their Friends collection.

    {
        public static int CountFriendsOf(Friend friend, IEnumerable<Person> people)
        {
            return people.Count(c => c.Friends.Contains(friend));
        }
    }
    
    public class Person
    {
        public string Name {get;}
        public IEnumerable<Friend> Friends {get;}
        
        public Person(string name, IEnumerable<Friend> friends)
        {
            Name = name;
            Friends = friends;
        }
    }
