Sum - coding exercise 1
Implement the TotalLength method, which given a collection of words will calculate the sum of their lengths.

For example, for words {"little", "brown", "fox"} the result shall be 14 because the lengths of those words are 6, 5, and 3, which sums up to 14.

Assume the result is not null

using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.Linq;

namespace Coding.Exercise
{
    public class Exercise
    {
       public static int TotalLength(IEnumerable<string> words)
        {
            return words.Sum(s => s.Length);
        }
    }
}
