Sum - coding exercise 2
Implement the AverageSum method, which given a nested collection of numbers (so a collection of collections of numbers) will return the average sum for those collections.

For example, for the following input...

{

    {1,2,3,2}, //sum is 8

    {1,5,6}, //sum is 12

    {2,2} //sum is 4

}

...the result shall be 8 because the average sum is (8+12+4)/3 = 8.

Assume the result is not null and non-empty.

using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.Linq;

namespace Coding.Exercise
{
    public class Exercise
    {
       public static double AverageSum(IEnumerable<IEnumerable<int>> collectionsOfNumbers)
        {
            //TODO your code goes here
            return collectionsOfNumbers.Select(s => s.Sum()).Average();
        }
    }
}
