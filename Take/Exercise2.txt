Take - coding exercise 2
Implement the GetGivenPercentOfHeaviestPets method, which given a collection of pets and a percent, shall return this percent of the pets who are heaviest.

For example:

for pets with weights {20, 10, 40, 5, 3, 16} and 50 percent, the result collection should contain those pets who weigh 40, 20, 16 kilograms. We take 3 heaviest pets because 50% of the pets are 3 pets

for pets with weights {50, 5, 6, 25} and 30 percent, the result collection should contain a single pet that weighs 50 kilograms. We only want the single, heaviest pet, because 30% of 4 is 1.2, which we floor down to 1

The order of the result collection does not matter.
